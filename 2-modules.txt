Modules
- Every file is a module by default

How to export
- Used module.exports = {function/variable} --> only put in object if multiple
- Use keyword require to import into the file --> always use a relative path starting with period
- see 2- modules, name, utils

Alternative method of export
- uses export as you go method
- module.exports.variable/object/function 
- see 2-altSyntax

Another Alternative method
- You can have a file where the function is called at the end
- import without assignment and it will run
